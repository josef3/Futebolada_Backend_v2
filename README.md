## General Info

Me and my friends usually go play football every weekend and I've come with an idea for us to be able to see our individual performance and progress weekend after weekend,
so I've decided to put my last months of learning into practise and produce a system to manage the main player's stats 📈. (The games are recorded and then analyzed 🎥)
